ðŸŽµ Spotify Local Bands
=================

About
=====

Code to find upcoming bands playing locally and convert their songs into a Spotify playlist. This uses BandsInTown which you can see inside `scrapebands.py`.

Requirements
============
* Spotify
* [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/)

Also set these environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` or whichever you're using. You can get these from Spotfiy [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) but you also need to click "Edit Settings" for your app and add the redirect uri below:

```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET'
export SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8899/callback'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_PLAYLISTID='SPOTIFY_CLIENT_PLAYLISTID'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID'
```

Running
======

Once you have made the correct modifications (which could take some time if you are scraping from a different website for your area) then run the following from your terminal (assuming you have the above requirements).

```Python
python spotifybrisbane.py
```

Tested On
=========
Tested on Mac OS X 13.2.1 Ventura with Python 3.8. This should work on other
platforms, however.


Listen In
=========
You can access the [Brisbane playlist here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3PjTtXAvsLe3C59USzfkni?si=54a5eb05b5d84d99)!
